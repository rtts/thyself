## Know thyself!

Thyself is a platform for self-measurements. You use the web interface to determine the questions you want to ask yourself, and than a client such as your smartphone will popup the questions at predetermined intervals. This could also be very useful in psychological research, to get novel types of data in a very flexible manner.

This repository contains some experimental code, but Thyself is by no means ready for use. Checkout the [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) community for more usable self-tracking software.

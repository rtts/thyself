    <h2>
      Thyself is a platform for self-measurement, currently being developed by the people from <a href="http://r2src.com/">Return to the Source</a>.
    </h2>

    <h3>Project status: idea stage</h3>
    <p>
      Thyself will be a combination of a smartphone app and a website. You can program the app to ask questions to yourself at predefined times. After our release you can use this website to explore and download the results. We're also planning to host a repository of ready-to-use questionnaires that will enable you to compare your test scores with others. And there's a whole lot more we want to make: a developers API, support for multiple participants, adaptive testing... So please let us go back to work now!

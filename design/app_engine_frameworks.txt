App Engine Frameworks
---------------------
App Engine specific

Frameworks designed specifically for App Engine.

  GAEO - Google App Engine Oil
    
    Somewhere between webapp and Django in complexity
    Not yet fully developed, seems amateuristic (partly due to the bad
    english)
    
  GAE Framework
    
    Designed for high-load sites
    Seems amateuristic
    They recommend using ubuntu and eclipse :O
    
  Kay (also based on Werkzeug and Jinja2)
    
    
    
  MVCEngine
  
    Has something to do with Rails, yuk
  
  tipfy (oh yeah, we love it!)
    
    Extended version of webapp: i18n, sessions, own authentication, flash
    messages and more
    
    uses Werkzeug
    
  webapp
  
    Yeah we know this one..
  
  webapp2 
    
    webapp2 is a single file that follows the simplicity of webapp, but
    improves it in some ways: it adds better URI routing and exception
    handling, a full featured response object and a more flexible
    dispatching mechanism.
    
    webapp2 also offers the package webapp2_extras with several optional
    utilities: sessions, localization, internationalization, domain and
    subdomain routing, secure cookies and others.
    

Conclusion:
It is hard for me to decide which is the best, since I don't really know
what we are looking for. I thought our app engine site only had to do the
api stuff, and it shouldn't provide users with the website. in that case,
you wouldn't need templates, right? And if you don't need templates, then
what do you need a framework for?

As I understand, we don't want anything as bloated as Django, but maybe an
alternative / extension to webapp. Werkzeug seems interesting, professional,
stable. But this is only a library, not a framework. 

I'd say we just use webapp, it has the most extensive tutorial, and I guess
most developers use it..?

Thyself Elevator Pitch
----------------------
What is the overlapping feature of tests, questionnaires, quizzes, and self
measurements? What do you do when you want to know how happy your employees
are, how your diet is working out, or how much you know about history? You
ask questions! You can ask others or yourself, the questions can be about
satisfaction, weight, or the golden era, but something is definitely
asked. This also means that a response is given. This response can be right
or wrong (in a quiz), it can be comparable to other people's responses, or
it might just be something you need to remember.

Thyself offers a platform on which all these different applications (and
more!) can be, built. If you are a user of Thyself, you may use it to keep 
track of your fitness program, take some quizzes once in a while, or even perform
research! You can decide for yourself what you want to ask yourself or
others, and what responses you expect. If you decide this might be helpful
for others, you can bundle your questions in a program and release it to 
the public! 

When you own a smartphone, you can use it to help you with the programs you
are following. It will remind you when you have to answer a question, and
can even be used offline!

Some questions simply cannot be answered by a computer alone. 





Thyself offers a complete solution for questionnaires, tests, and
measurements. 

It aims to be a platform on which several websites can be built.

Its unique feature is adding recurring questions to the domain
of questioning. 

Thyself offers social and clinical psychologists, as well as consumers the
possibility to create and publish testing programs.

There is a large market for internet-based testing, but none of them use
smartphones to efficiently get responses.
